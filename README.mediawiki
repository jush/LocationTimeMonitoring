= Location Time Monitoring =
The main purpose of this Android app is to be able to track how long you spent in a 
place based on the wifi networks.

For example you want to track how many hours you spent at work. Then you would set 
the app to monitor your work wifi

It does not use any kind of location (GPS or network based).
